To-Do List Page
Purpose: Keep tasks lightweight, context-aware, and synced with workflow.
> Context-Aware Tasks (Smart Capture)
- [x] Tasks from Nudges auto-inherit: attached files/links, sender, due date/time.
- [x] No manual copy-paste.

> Shared Task Blocks (Temporary)
- [x] Short-lived team lists (e.g., "Bug Fix List – Sprint Ends Friday").

> Catch-Up Mode
- [x] Summarizes changes for offline users instead of flooding notifications. When changing the status to offline, the user can see the changes in the catch-up modal that appears when they switch the status to something else then offline. The catch-up modal shows the changes in a list format with the task name, assignee, due date, and priority. The user can click on the task to see more details.
