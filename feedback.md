Reminder 
- [x] Reminders can be sorted based on recent or oldest or matter of importance
- [x] Also person should be able to add time associated to specific reminder and @ people- [x] Overview tabs - Says their title but it should what they are currently working on

Groups
- [x] On groups tab, clicking on it, it shows quick nudge. I assume this quick nudge is for the group. So we need to create a vision on the bottom sheet nudges and nudges page to show the group nudges.

Status bar
- [x] It should allow to click and drag, to see the ones hidden. While hovering the status card, it shouldn't show the three dots on the corners.

Sort 
- [x] Date created not necessary, newest and oldest
- [x] Change Name (A-Z) (Z-A) to Alphabetical (A-Z) (Z-A)

Nudge (Sort)
- [x] Sort needs to be based on recent and priority, so it needs to create a badge on the nudge card (similar to the ones used on dashboard user card) for priority.
- [x] Remove date created, Change Name (A-Z) (Z-A) to Alphabetical (A-Z) (Z-A). 
- [x] Add priority

Schedule
- [x] Remove the top bar with the 4 widgets
- [x] Change the position between team members (on left) and the user's selected schedule (on right)
- [x] Remove the role and status column, add the role below the user's name

Right side - All pages
- [x] Add a 24px tailwind equivalente to the right side on all pages
- [x] All the selected content the goes on the right, must have at least 48px on the bottom, because of the bottom sheet component, so it doesn't cover it

Sort & Esc
- [x] When selecting somenthing that changes the right sidebar content, the esc key should go back to the default view of the right sidebar
