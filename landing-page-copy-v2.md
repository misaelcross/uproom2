## The problem we solve
Your team is spread across chat, calendars, task boards, and files. That means slow alignment, lost context, and meetings that should’ve been a message. Uproom brings status, nudges, scheduling, tasks, and files into one place so work moves forward with less back-and-forth.

---

## “I don’t know who I can reach right now.”
- See real-time availability and current focus across your team at a glance.
- Open any teammate to view context like meetings, focus blocks, and recent activity.
- Instantly decide whether to nudge, schedule, or leave a note—without guessing.

Outcome: fewer interruptions, faster decisions, more respectful communication.

---

## “Quick asks become long threads that go nowhere.”
- Send a lightweight nudge instead of starting a noisy chat.
- Add attachments, polls, and priorities to clarify what you need.
- Convert a nudge into a todo in one click—no copy/paste or tool hopping.

Outcome: short, clear requests that turn into action—no meeting required.

---

## “Scheduling takes forever.”
- Browse availability without leaving your workspace.
- Pick people, times, and confirm details in a single flow.
- Link related tasks, files, and nudges to the event so context shows up with the meeting.

Outcome: minutes to schedule, not days of back-and-forth.

---

## “Work gets lost after the meeting.”
- Create todos with clear steps and ownership.
- Link todos to the relevant message, meeting, or file so nothing is out of context.
- Track progress from the same place you coordinate.

Outcome: meetings lead to momentum, not memory of what was said.

---

## “I can’t find the right subset of people.”
- Build ad‑hoc groups by role, project, or status in seconds.
- View group context and take action—nudge, schedule, or assign—directly from the group.

Outcome: fewer broadcast messages, faster coordination with exactly who matters.

---

## “Files and context are scattered.”
- Attach files directly to nudges, tasks, and meetings.
- See the documents you need right where the work happens.

Outcome: no more hunting across tools to find that one link.

---

## “I’m drowning in notifications.”
- Live notifications surface only what’s relevant—priority, pinning, and read states keep signal clear.
- Skim, act, and get back to focus.

Outcome: less noise, more flow.

---

## How it all works together
1) Nudge the right people based on live availability.  
2) If needed, schedule the meeting in one flow and attach the file.  
3) Convert outcomes into todos with steps and owners.  
4) Track progress from the same place—no context lost, no extra tools.

---

## What you save
- Time: Fewer tool switches and faster scheduling.  
- Money: Less time in unnecessary meetings and duplicated work.  
- Effort: Clearer requests, automatic context, and one workspace instead of four.

## FAQ
- Is this just another chat tool?  
No. Uproom prioritizes action over threads: nudges, availability, scheduling, and todos live together so messages lead to outcomes.

- Does it replace my calendar or task app?  
Uproom centralizes scheduling and tasks where coordination happens, so you don’t have to bounce between tools to move work forward.

- Can I use it if my team is hybrid or fully remote?  
Yes. Uproom is designed for distributed teams that need clarity, speed, and fewer meetings.
